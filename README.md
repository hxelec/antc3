These are the files for the 150g antweight combat robot I recently made. I made an all-in-one robot controller, which is, in my opinion, a better alternative to the Malenki-Nano and Malenki-HV, and a very low-cost ESP-NOW remote. The high-quality PCBs for this project were manufactured by PCBWay, and if you use my link to sign up: https://pcbway.com/g/x5f10h, you can get $5 off your first order and help support this (partially) open-source development. You can check out the video for this project on my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/@hxtec32?si=qvrlxVD-KIIIB9TC
The code does not have failsafe, and doesn't drive the robot fully straight by the way, but feel free to use it as a reference for bidirectional ESP-NOW communication. I would recommend reading this article too, as I adapted the code for my own use case: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp-now-two-way-communication-esp32/
By the way, you need the necessary Arduino files for a T-QT Pro before using my code, because it won't work if otherwise. The T-QT Pro is great for this project.
